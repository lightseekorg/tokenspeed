# GEMM weight preparation

## DeepSeek V4 grouped output projection

The grouped-projection plan describes the projection geometry and source formats.

After loading and sharding, the operation selects preprocessing using the source
formats and operation traits. The layer runs that preprocessing through the
weight broker, which installs the transformed tensors and records their storage
layout. When no transformation is needed, the layer enrolls canonical storage.

Execution and warmup select kernels using the supplied tensors' recorded layouts,
formats, and operation traits. Participating layers require known storage layouts;
raw canonical callers can explicitly allow unknown storage. This policy is
independent of kernel overrides. Python validation runs during graph capture,
not device-side replay.
