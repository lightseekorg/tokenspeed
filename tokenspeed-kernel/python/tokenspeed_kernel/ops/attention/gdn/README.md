# GDN FlashInfer PDL adapters

The FlashInfer adapter retains the upstream launch geometry and runtime ABI,
while wrapping device bodies with PDL synchronization. Adapted functions and
in-memory compilation caches live in private namespaces.

Decode and prefill explicitly select FlashInfer's CuTe backend. FlashInfer
0.7.0's automatic backend selection can use Cake GDN for supported shapes,
which bypasses the PDL-wrapped device bodies. Regression tests cover both
power-of-two and other head groupings and reject calls into that alternate path.

FlashInfer 0.7.0 also persists CuTe-DSL kernels to disk. PDL artifacts use a
separate `tokenspeed_pdl_` module namespace so an ordinary kernel cannot satisfy
a PDL cache lookup, or vice versa. Cache invalidation includes all upstream
source files plus the local PDL and GDN adapter sources. Installed FlashInfer
modules and the process-wide cache configuration remain untouched.

GPU regression tests cover persistent cache hits after clearing the in-memory
cache, invalidation after source changes, and both launch orders. Runtime GDN
tests additionally check CUDA Graph dependency edges and exact replay results
for decode, MTP, BF16 state, and prefill.

## Variable prefill lengths

The Triton L2-normalization fallback uses a runtime token count. The launch
grid and masked block pointers cover the exact rows, while head width and tile
size stay compile-time parameters. Consecutive agentic turns therefore reuse
one compiled kernel across different token counts instead of compiling a new
variant for each length. Tests compare irregular lengths around the usual
prefill graph buckets against an independent PyTorch result.

Compilation guards warm these kernels, then sweep token counts (and PLE
request counts) without allowing new Triton specializations. PLE covers
transitions between single-request, uniform multi-request and ragged indexing
within one compiled kernel. Those selections use runtime values so startup
warmup also covers batch layouts first seen during serving.
