# Deep sparse attention kernels

The DSA operators separate sparse-history selection from attention:

- `dsa_prefill_topk` and `dsa_decode_topk` score the index cache and produce
  padded global KV slots plus a live length for every query.
- `dsa_prefill` and `dsa_decode` consume those selected slots and read the
  latent KV cache.
- `dsa_plan` owns optional decode planning state.

AMD CDNA4/gfx950 and CDNA5/gfx1250 provide Gluon implementations for full
selected attention. The gfx1250 implementation supports BF16, E4M3, and E5M2
queries; dense or packed KV rows; page size 64; latent ranks 128 and 512; and
optional 64-wide RoPE. A zero RoPE width selects the same kernel path with the
RoPE storage, gathers, and score term compiled out.

GLM-5.3-Flash uses the zero-RoPE specialization with
`qk_nope_head_dim=256`, `kv_lora_rank=512`, and 16 local heads at TP4. Its
KPool selection has a configured width of 2048 and can append three tail
positions, so both prefill and decode accept padded slot widths 2048 through
2051. The live `topk_lens` value determines how many entries participate in
the online softmax; unused entries remain `-1`.

Portable Triton implementations remain the fallback for trait combinations
without a matching native registration.


The portable Triton attention implementations support `return_lse=True` for
both dense and packed latent caches. They return `(output, lse)`, with FP32
natural-log LSE shaped `[tokens, heads]`; all-invalid rows produce zero output
and negative-infinite LSE. This permits exact softmax-weighted merging of
context-partitioned sparse attention. Supplying `out` preserves the supplied
output buffer even when returning LSE. Omitting `topk_lens` uses the full padded
slot width, with negative slots still excluded.

DeepGEMM index scoring is registered for 16, 32, or 64 index heads. The
16-head case pads queries and weights to its native 32-head ABI with zeros;
caller-provided scoring scales and forced initial/local candidate policies
remain unchanged. Other head counts are excluded by kernel traits.

FlashMLA sparse prefill (regular BF16 KV) and sparse decode (packed FP8 KV)
also support `return_lse=True`. Both return natural-log LSE `[tokens, heads]`
and normalize empty rows to zero output / negative-infinite LSE for the shared
DCP reduction. `topk_lens` masks excluded columns before dispatch, and supplied
output buffers retain their identity. Decode transposes the vendor's
`[batch, heads, query]` LSE to token-major order. This does not reinterpret
regular BF16 KV as packed FP8 or change its Triton decode selection.

## Sharded Index-K candidates

`dsa_index_candidates` scores a bounded query tile against rank-local Index-K
for prefill and decode. Inputs are a position-preserving page table (`-1` for
absent pages), request IDs and global causal lengths. Outputs are global logical
offsets and FP32 scores: invalid candidates use `-1`/`-inf`, and forced
initial/local candidates use `+inf`. Cross-rank merging belongs to runtime DCP.

DeepGEMM compacts owned, causally visible pages and maps results back to global
offsets, masking padding and handling partial tails and empty shards. Query
quantization and head padding match the unsharded path; portable Triton provides
the same interface. Query tiling bounds scratch memory, and fixed-shape GPU
metadata supports CUDA graph replay without host reads.
