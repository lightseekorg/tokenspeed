# AMD LLM Kernels

## Kernel Conventions

### Barriers

Do not write `gl.barrier()` for shared-memory (LDS) hazards. The Gluon
compiler's membar analysis tracks every LDS read, write, atomic, async copy,
and scratch-backed op (layout conversions, reductions, atomic result
broadcasts), and inserts a CTA barrier immediately before the first conflicting
access, including across loop back-edges. It also emits a barrier right after
every `async_copy.wait_group`/`tdm.async_wait`, and the lowering of a
`release`/`acq_rel` atomic emits one before it (an `acquire` atomic emits one
after it). A manual barrier next to any of these is a duplicate `s_barrier`, or
worse, it lands earlier than the compiler's minimal placement and pins the
instruction schedule.

Keep an explicit `gl.barrier()` only where the compiler cannot see the hazard:

- Ordering global-memory traffic across threads of one workgroup: init stores
  followed by an overlapping scatter, all-thread stores or atomics that must be
  issued before one thread bumps a `relaxed` counter, or re-reading a global
  buffer other threads just wrote. Say what the barrier orders in a comment.
- `load_shared_relaxed` pipelines. That load opts out of the compiler's
  async-copy hazard tracking, so the write-after-read against the next
  `buffer_load_to_shared` into the same slot is the kernel's responsibility.
  Place the barrier before the copy that reuses the slot.

## Sampling

### Argmax

`tokenspeed_kernel.argmax` returns row-wise indices for `(M, N)` logits. AMD
Gluon kernels are selected automatically on gfx950 and gfx1250 when the optional
`tokenspeed-kernel-amd` package provides both implementations. If either import
is unavailable, the public API falls back to PyTorch.

#### Contract

- Kernel inputs are 2D FP16/BF16/FP32 GPU tensors with `N >= 4096` and unit
  vocabulary stride. Padded row strides are supported.
- Optional `out` is an int32/int64 tensor of shape `(M,)` on the input device;
  strided outputs are supported and returned directly. Without `out`, the
  operator allocates an int64 result.
- Ties choose the lowest index. NaNs are ignored; all-NaN rows return `-1`.
  Unsupported inputs fall back to `torch.argmax`, including its NaN semantics.
- Scratch is isolated by device and stream and reused across
  serialized calls. Graphs sharing warmed scratch must also replay serially.
  Warm up on the capture stream to avoid scratch initialization during capture;
  cold captures keep their allocations out of the eager cache.

#### Algorithm

Each workgroup loads a vocabulary tile and reduces `(value, index)` pairs.
Small batches split rows across workgroups. A GPU-scope acquire/release counter
publishes completion; the last workgroup reduces the partial results and resets
the counter in the same launch. Larger batches use one workgroup per row,
iterating over vocabulary tiles without atomic scratch traffic.

On gfx1250, split counts account for row count and vocabulary width, and FP32
tile widths are capped to limit register pressure. A bounded CPU cache reuses
configuration choices across calls. Split counts need not be powers of two;
the final reduction masks unused partial-result slots.

The gfx950 implementation uses CDNA4 buffer loads and 64-lane waves. The gfx1250
port uses 32-lane waves and buffer loads for split reductions and single tiles.
Larger rows use double-buffered TDM loads, overlapping the next tile's transfer
with per-lane candidate updates and reducing across lanes once per row. TDM's
zero padding is masked before comparison. Tile sizes account for element size
and batch size to limit shared-memory usage.
