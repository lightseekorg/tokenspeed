# AMD LLM Kernels

## Sampling

### Argmax

`tokenspeed_kernel.argmax` returns row-wise indices for `(M, N)` logits. AMD
Gluon kernels are selected automatically on gfx950 and gfx1250 when the optional
`tokenspeed-kernel-amd` package provides both implementations. If either import
is unavailable, the public API falls back to PyTorch.

#### Contract

- Kernel inputs are 2D FP16/BF16/FP32 GPU tensors with `N >= 4096` and unit
  vocabulary stride. Padded row strides are supported.
- Optional `out` is an int32/int64 tensor of shape `(M,)` on the input device;
  strided outputs are supported and returned directly. Without `out`, the
  operator allocates an int64 result.
- Ties choose the lowest index. NaNs are ignored; all-NaN rows return `-1`.
  Unsupported inputs fall back to `torch.argmax`, including its NaN semantics.
- Scratch is isolated by device and stream and reused across
  serialized calls. Graphs sharing warmed scratch must also replay serially.
  Warm up on the capture stream to avoid scratch initialization during capture;
  cold captures keep their allocations out of the eager cache.

#### Algorithm

Each workgroup loads a vocabulary tile and reduces `(value, index)` pairs.
Small batches split rows across workgroups. A GPU-scope acquire/release counter
publishes completion; the last workgroup reduces the partial results and resets
the counter in the same launch. Larger batches use one workgroup per row,
iterating over vocabulary tiles without atomic scratch traffic.

On gfx1250, split counts account for row count and vocabulary width, and FP32
tile widths are capped to limit register pressure. A bounded CPU cache reuses
configuration choices across calls. Split counts need not be powers of two;
the final reduction masks unused partial-result slots.

The gfx950 implementation uses CDNA4 buffer loads and 64-lane waves. The gfx1250
port uses 32-lane waves and buffer loads for split reductions and single tiles.
Larger rows use double-buffered TDM loads, overlapping the next tile's transfer
with per-lane candidate updates and reducing across lanes once per row. TDM's
zero padding is masked before comparison. Tile sizes account for element size
and batch size to limit shared-memory usage.
